# Open Source Projects to look at:
## AGENCY: https://github.com/goldschmidt/agency
### Licensing:
 - Looking through the git repo, the license used for AGENCY is the GPL-3.0 license. This implies that the project is working with copyrighted material and wishes to make sure that any working on this project does not created something that could violate that copyright.
### Language:
 - There are two main Languages used in this project, PHP and Postgres (Though that info is not obvious from the repo, researching more about the product, AGENCY, shows that most of its code is written in PHP and Postgres). While having a set language is nice (it allows the head of the project to filter developers), not having those languages on the repo could lead to problems for developers who are interested on this project but don't know how to prepare for work.
### Activity:
- Due to the fact that this is a new project, there aren't any commits at all within the repo (save for the intial commits). While not a problem in itself, if the project is unable to garner any commits within the coming months, it may lead to other developers assuming the project has been abandoned.
### Number of contributors:
- Like the previous paragraph elaborated, this is a new project. As such there is really only one contributor, the developer who made the inital commits. Once again, this isn't really a problem right now seeing as the project just started. But if this project cannot find more contributors soon, any developer who stumbles upon this may think AGENCY has been abandoned.
### Size:
- Once again, since this project is new, there isn't any code of substance. There is a source forge site for the AGENCY code itself, however since the linked repo in RCOS doesn't directly include that forge site, I'm assuming that it's not going to part of the project.
### New Contributor:
- However, one thing that really isn't excusable is the complete lack of any "getting started" page. Granted this is an RCOS project so all "getting started" material may be obtained through the meetings, but assuming that every single future developer needs to go thorugh a one time meeting to get the basic info of this project is asking too much from a developer. However, since it is a new project one can give the benefit of a doubt.
### Community Norms:

### User base:
- While there isn't a direct link to the userbase from the repo, looking at the actual software (AGENCY) reveals that there is a fairly large user base for this software. In particular looking through the website it seems AGENCY is useful for non profit organizations as a means of organizing various non profit events. While the site does have a download page, it is quite hard to actual download and install the software as there isn't any clear cut instructions.
