# Open Source Licensing

## Why is it important to choose a LICENSE?
  - By having an explicit license on your project you communicate to other potential developers that you are willing and able to provide the four essential freedoms to them. Moreover, by having an explicit license you don't run the risk of distrust among your developers (ie if you don't have a good license they might not even work)

## Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
  - If a project does not have an explicit license, then by the laws of the government, all work that you do will be credited to the original developer. Essentially, by working on a project with no license you are allowing the original developer to profit of your work, while you get no compensation.

## Do you agree with the claim of Why the Web beat Gopher?
  - Based on the "Failure to follow the open systems model" section, I do agree with the claims that the Web beat Gopher. From what I read Gopher did not adhere to the four essential freedoms that all open source projects tend to follow. As a result, software like Panda forked from Gopher and became successful on its own (while not contributing anything back to Gopher). On the other hand the Web did follow all the freedoms (open up their source code for the community early on, played to the Internet Standards etc.) and as a result had all their developers working on their project.

## Justify why Android, Microsoft and SailfishOS use their respective licenses
  - Looking through .NET Core repository it seems that there isn't any reason main thing they want from their developers. especially from looking through the README.md there are various paragraphs for various uses that you may have for the code (ie there is a section for just using .NET core versus if you don't even want to see the source code). Due to this general standpoint with .NET the fact that Microsoft uses a MIT license fits the project very well as the MIT license, in summary, is "a short, permissive software license. Basically, you can do whatever you ant as long as you include the original copyright..." which pretty much describes the stance described above.

## Think of an example project and Pick a license
  - The license that we all agreed on was the MIT license, mostly for its more general use it has compared to the other licenses. An example project we had was perhaps a web application that helps students keep track of their expenditure during college

## Which type of license is best for a developer, for a company, and for the common good?
  - For a developer, I believe the best license to use is GPL because it allows you as the developer to track changes made to your software. For a company the best license to use is probably the apache/BSD license as it prevents sub developers to trademark the work and thus conflicting with the company. For the common good, it seems GPL is the best license is the best as it allows people to modify source code without allowing those same people to take advantage of other people's work

## Write about a project to work on, the user base and what license you would choose
  For me, I'd like to work on a project focusing on either web based development or a gaming application. I'd personally like the user base to be RPI students, mostly because I can relate to them the best (obviously). But I'd imagine that eventually said application could extend to similar college aged students or even younger age crowds depending on the specifics of the project (ie a project focusing on facilitating studying habits vs a project focusing on finance management). As for the license, I'd personally use the MIT license mostly because of how flexible it seems to be. Granted it might not be the best in every scenario but for a small group project I'd say a MIT license would work pretty well.
