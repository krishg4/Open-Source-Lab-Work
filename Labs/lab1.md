Chapter 3 Review:
  Well one thing I felt from reading this chapter was how outdated/abusable copyright law is. When copyright was first created, it was mostly used to protect physical assets, however with the creation of the internet and advancement of technology we can see a slow transition to more digital assets. The rising problem is that people then start to present their own interpretation of copyright law onto these situations, which leads to cases like this. Its a shame because due to this abuse people like Jesse can be essentially bullied out of their hard work. Work that could've caused a change.
